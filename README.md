# Topic 17 - Practice with Bayes' Theorem

 Click into the Illumidesk link for some practice with Bayes' Theorem.

We wanted to do this kind of work using real and accurate COVID-19 data, but unfortunately we just don't know enough about the exact sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 tests (or that data is buried such that I wasn't able to find it). If you'd like to explore some of the data from a Bayesian perspective, here are a few links where you can get started.

- The FDA's [A Closer Look at COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing](https://www.fda.gov/health-professionals/closer-look-covid-19-diagnostic-testing) page has a section on Test Performance, in which you can see how the medical language of specificity/sensitivity connects to false positives and false negatives
- The FDA has published a page on [Authorized Serology Test Performance](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance), which shares the sensitivity and specificity of specific antigen tests. Read more about how to understand how prevalence impacts test results [here](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory) - definitely something you can interpret in a Bayesian way!
- Relatedly, Georgia Tech released a [visual exploration](https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/) of the risk of attending a gathering with someone who has COVID-19, down to the county level and depending on the size of the gathering and expected prevalence of the disease
- Someone did go through and explore different ways of thinking about COVID tests through a Bayesian lens if you'd like to work through their examples, check that out [here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/20/covid-19-test-accuracy-supplement-the-math-of-bayes-theorem/)
